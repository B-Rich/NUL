#+TODO: TODO FEEDBACK VERIFY | DONE CANCELED
#+STARTUP: content

Thank you for obtaining your personal NOVA userland (NUL) source
tree. You will not be disappointed.

* Prerequisites

 - binutils 2.19 or later
 - GCC 4.2 or later
 - scons 1.2.0 or later

* Directory Layout

The NUL tree consists of several applications and libraries, which are
loosely grouped by topic into repositories. Each subdirectory of the
top-level directory is a repository.

** TODO Describe layout of individual repositories

* Building

To build NUL you need a build directory. Luckily, there is already a
preconfigured one in build/. We use a minimal SCons-based build system
that mostly does what we want. So to build the default configuration
just cd into build and type 'scons'. Binaries will be installed in
build/bin by default.

To use a customized build configuration, copy the default build
repository and adapt its SConstruct file.
