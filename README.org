Thank you for obtaining your personal NOVA userland (NUL) source
tree. You will not be disappointed.

* Org-Mode HOWTO						   :noexport:

  This file uses Org-Mode, which ships with a nice manual that you can
  find via the Info browser (C-h i). I recommend reading the 5min
  tutorial, if you are unfamiliar with Org-Mode:
  http://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/

  Some hints:
  C-c C-t: Cycle through TODO states.
  C-c C-z: Take a note.
  TAB on section header: Cycle through visibility states.
  Shift-TAB: Toggle overview.
  C-c C-e l: Export as LaTeX. :-D

* Prerequisites

  - *Binutils* 2.19 or later
  - *GCC* 4.2 or later
  - *SCons[fn:1]* 1.2.0 or later
  - *Git* 1.6 or later

* Where To Get It

  The latest public version is available by cloning our Git
  repository. You have to be member of the =nul-hackers= group to
  commit.

  =git clone ssh://os.inf.tu-dresden.de/srv/git/repos/nul.git=

* Directory Layout

  The NUL tree consists of several applications and libraries, which
  are loosely grouped by topic into repositories. Each subdirectory of
  the top-level directory is a repository.

** /nova/

   The kernel bindings and a very small example roottask live in this
   repository.

** TODO Describe /vancouver/
*** INPROGRESS Move vancouver/lib/runtime into nova/

* Building

  To build NUL you need a build directory. Luckily, there is already a
  preconfigured one in /build/. We use a minimal SCons-based build
  system that mostly does what we want. So to build the default
  configuration just cd into build and type =scons=. Binaries will be
  installed in build/bin by default.

  To use a customized build configuration, copy the default build
  repository and adapt its SConstruct file.

* Tasks

** TODO Organize 3rd-Party Source Code
*** TODO Move vancouver/lib/tinf to some kind of contrib/ directory
    - Note taken on [2009-11-13 Fri 16:12] \\
      rocknshine including tinf should perhaps move to their own
      repo. Something like julian-stuff.


* Footnotes

[fn:1] We are actively exploring alternatives to write our build system, but SCons fills in quite nicely for now.
