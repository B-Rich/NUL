* Demos
  - VM: dope, scout, fbcon, xserver, skype, nova
  - nethack/slashem
  - tetris

* Usability

 - command language/shell
 - improve vmm command line arguments
 - C-friendly syscall bindings
 - move VMM to end of guest memory

* VMM Models
 - e1000
 - PMTimer
 - HPET

* VMM
 - ACPI in VBIOS
 - VBIOS for x86emu

* Drivers

** General
  - Linux driver VMs (ideally without IO-MMUs)

** USB
  - EHCI/OHCI/UHCI/XHCI
  - USB passthrough

** USB HID
  - USB keyboard and mice speak a simplified BOOT protocol, normally used by the BIOS
  - need UHCI/OHCI low level drivers to scan the bus and request keycodes
  - should allow to get rid of legacy USB support and its SMIs

** Disk
 - Buffer cache
 - partition support
 - volume management?
 - backing store in filesystem
 - disk scheduling
 - SR-IOV AHCI
 - iSCSI/SBP-2/network block device as backing store

** Network

 - e1000
 - rtl8139
 - IP over 1394
 - TCP/IP stack (uIP6)
 - optimized software switch (zero copy)
