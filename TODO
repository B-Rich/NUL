* Usability

 - irq routing (ATARE)
 - command language/shell
 - improve vmm command line arguments
 - C-friendly syscall bindings in nova/

* Drivers

** General
  - Linux driver VMs (ideally without IO-MMUs)

** USB
  - EHCI/OHCI/UHCI/XHCI
  - USB passthrough

** USB HID
  - USB keyboard and mice speak a simplified BOOT protocol, normally used by the BIOS
  - need UHCI/OHCI low level drivers to scan the bus and request keycodes
  - should allow to get rid of legacy USB support and its SMIs

** Disk

 - Buffer cache
 - partition support
 - volume management?
 - backing store in filesystem
 - disk scheduling
 - SR-IOV AHCI
 - iSCSI/SBP-2/network block device as backing store

** Network

 - e1000
 - rtl8139
 - IP over 1394
 - TCP/IP stack (uIP6)
 - optimized software switch (zero copy)
 
* Rocknshine
